                <br>
                <p class="center">In the last 2-3 decades, We extracted & ruin the natural resources which resulted as a unbalanced state b/w humans & nature. About 17 percent of the Amazonian rainforest has been destroyed over the past 50 years, and losses recently have been on the rise.Greenhouse gases are another source of air pollution and human activities such as burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has increased the greenhouse effect, and average temperatures across the globe are rising and due to this 
                    Earth is now losing 1.2 trillion tons of ice each year. And itâ€™s going to get worse.Today, we produce about 300 million tonnes of plastic waste every year. That's nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population. Globally, 100,000 marine mammals die every year as a result of plastic pollution. This includes whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea lions.  </p>

                <h2 class="h-secondery center">WHAT SHOULD BE OUR MINDSET</h2>
               <center> <p>We can bring back the green layer only if each one of us take little steps & support Alfresco green to help you take the proper measures.We should start giving respect to this beautiful place god has provided us. All the area of it's wilderness and beauty that we have snacthed from it we can give it back. Be thankful and kind towards other creatures. We all are ultimately the part of ecosystem, each life matters. till now upto one million plant species face extinction, many within decades, because of human activities. while, writing this line i feel like crying.Just, thinking about all those creatures just geting erased from this earth is just heart breaking and i don't understand that how easy it is for us to just ignore all this. Many of you just thinks about how to live in luxary.Start respecting nature and start protecting it. don't think about it as a necessary thing which you just have to do, think it as your duty.
